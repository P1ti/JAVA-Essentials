# JAVA-Essentials
Here is my road map while remembering coding. The code is from the homeworks I received at a Java course.
The course covers some basic principals:
1. Classes and objects
2. Hierarchization and inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstract classes
5. Interfaces
6. Object containers
7. Exceptions
8. I/O operations
